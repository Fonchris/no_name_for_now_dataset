# 🌐 Translation Application (Study Project) - Dataset Creation Phase

## 📋 Project Description

This project is currently in its initial phase, focusing on the creation of high-quality dictionaries to support a future translation application. The goal is to compile comprehensive word lists for translation between English, French, Fulfulde, and Ghomala, specifically for the following language pairs:

* 🇫🇷 → 🗣️ French to Fulfulde
* 🇫🇷 → 🗣️ French to Ghomala
* 🇬🇧 → 🗣️ English to Fulfulde
* 🇬🇧 → 🗣️ English to Ghomala

This phase involves utilizing existing datasets, web scraping from online resources, and manual data entry to build these dictionaries. The dictionaries will initially be stored in Excel format.

The subsequent phase of the project will involve developing the mobile application using these created datasets for translation functionality.

## 🔤 Supported Languages (for Dictionary Creation)

* 🇬🇧 English
* 🇫🇷 French
* 🗣️ Fulfulde
* 🗣️ Ghomala

## 🔍 Current Phase: Dataset Collection

The current focus is on gathering and organizing vocabulary for the translation dictionaries. This involves:

1.  📚 **Utilizing Existing Resources:** Incorporating available datasets (like the provided Bible dataset).
2.  🌐 **Web Scraping:** Extracting vocabulary from online dictionaries and language resources (e.g., kemelang.com, webonary.org, glosbe.com, lamba-africa.com).
3.  ✍️ **Manual Compilation:** Manually adding and verifying words to ensure a comprehensive vocabulary.

## 🔮 Future Phases

The next stages of the project will involve:

* 📱 Developing the user interface for the mobile application.
* ⚙️ Implementing the translation logic using the created dictionaries.
* 📸 (Optional) Implementing the image-based translation feature.

## 🎓 Study Information (Optional)

This project is part of a study focused on advancing NLP for LRL.
